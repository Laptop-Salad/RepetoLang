# RepetoLang

- <b>Simplicity</b> similar to Python, making it accessible and easy to use.
- <b>Flexibility in application architecture</b>, meaning it doesnâ€™t force you into a specific paradigm (like heavy reliance on classes), which is attractive if you want to choose your own design patterns.
- <b>Dual typing system</b>, allowing you to choose the level of type safety you need for different parts of your application.
- <b>Rich standard library</b> inspired by PHP. Since this language is aimed towards console applications the standard library provides a wide array of helpers for this.

In the long run, this language is designed to be a general purpose language but to start with it is aimed at console applications.
